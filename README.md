# iPool-seq
Snakemake pipeline for iPool-Seq approach originally created by the group of Armin Djamei - [In vivo insertion pool sequencing identifies virulence factors in a complex fungalâ€“host interaction](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005129)
  
With this repo we intend to generalize the approach and offer easy modification and adaptation to any insertion mutant approach (transposons; A. tumefaciens-derived; T-DNA libraries; etc.)


Current status: just beginning ;D
